Getting home is typically a matter of choosing the shortest or fastest path. A typical directions service will choose the cheapest, or fastest, or shortest path, but when it comes to safety it's up to the user to decide based on 'gut-feeling' which way to go home.

Street Shark knits together publicly available crime data with a various predictors to build a totally *JAWSOME* dataset of the safest areas in your city.

Street Shark highlights dangerous areas of your city in red, based on your gender and age and the time of day. When the user enters a destination, the Street Shark navigates a path to avoid dangerous zones automatically. Through-out the day the application is updated with the latest crime prediction and routes are recalculated automatically.
